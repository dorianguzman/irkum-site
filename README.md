# Irikum - Artisanal Jewelry

**Where Light Becomes Legacy**

Bespoke jewelry born from the iridescent heart of Mexican opals, designed in Amsterdam, shaped by artisan hands.

## About

Irikum is born from the convergence of two rich traditions—the refined design heritage of Amsterdam and the ancient artisanal mastery of Mexico. Our name whispers of iridescence and Mokum, the beloved old name for Amsterdam.

Each piece begins as a dialogue between cultures: conceived in the canal-side ateliers of Amsterdam, then brought to life by skilled hands in Mexican workshops where generations have perfected the art of working with precious metals and stones.

## Our Materials

- **Mexican Opal** - Ethically sourced from family-owned mines in Querétaro and Jalisco
- **18K Gold & Silver** - Responsibly sourced precious metals with traditional hand-finishing
